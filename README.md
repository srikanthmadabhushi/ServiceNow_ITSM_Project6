# ServiceNow Project: Smart Form Behavior with UI Policies, Client Scripts & GenAI

## Objective
Create a dynamic Incident form that auto-shows fields, auto-fills values, and suggests categories using AI.

## Steps
1. Configure a UI Policy (Impact = High → show Work Notes).
2. Add a Client Script (Category = Network → set Assignment Group = Network Support).
3. Create AI Category Suggestion field with GenAI-generated text.
4. Test and verify dynamic form behavior.

## AI Integration
- GenAI → Suggests incident category.
- Predictive Intelligence (optional) → Learns from data to auto-classify fields.

## Outcome
Interactive, AI-assisted form that reduces manual errors and improves service quality.
